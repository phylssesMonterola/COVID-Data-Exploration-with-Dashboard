In this repository. I delved into COVID data exploration once more using the following data analysis tools: SQL Server Management Studio, Microsoft Excel, and Tableau Public

Data sets:
CovidDeaths & CovidVaccinations

SQL Server Management Studio was used to get the result/output of our COVID Data Exploration with the output copied and pasted into Excel Worksheets to be imported later into Tableau Public

Files to be Imported:
Sheet 1, Sheet 2, Sheet 3, Sheet 4

Will take the Tableau Public URL of the project's dashboard to be posted in GitHub/portfolio website soon.

This project got me to have a feel of what it's like to clean data, the process of importing data sets from excel to sql to tableau, practice writing queries and the thought process of building the scripts, and building the dashboard appropriate for the data set to have better visualizations.
